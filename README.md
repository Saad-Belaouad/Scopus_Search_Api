## BLUIT WITH :
### 1.JAVA :
The Java programming language was developed by Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. Although it is primarily used for Internet-based applications, Java is a simple, efficient, general-purpose language. Java was originally designed for embedded network applications running on multiple platforms. It is a portable, object-oriented, interpreted language.

### 2.JSOUP LIBRARY :
jsoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API for fetching URLs and extracting and manipulating data, using the best of HTML5 DOM methods and CSS selectors.

jsoup implements the WHATWG HTML5 specification, and parses HTML to the same DOM as modern browsers do.

* scrape and parse HTML from a URL, file, or string
* find and extract data, using DOM traversal or CSS selectors
* manipulate the HTML elements, attributes, and text
* clean user-submitted content against a safe white-list, to prevent XSS attacks
* output tidy HTML
jsoup is designed to deal with all varieties of HTML found in the wild; from pristine and validating, to invalid tag-soup; jsoup will create a sensible parse tree.

### 3.JSON LIBRARY 

JSON is a light-weight, language independent, data interchange format. See http://www.JSON.org/ The files in this package implement JSON encoders/decoders in Java. It also includes the capability to convert between JSON and XML, HTTP headers, Cookies, and CDL. This is a reference implementation. There is a large number of JSON packages in Java. Perhaps someday the Java community will standardize on one. Until then, choose carefully. The license includes this restriction: "The software shall be used for good, not evil." If your conscience cannot live with that, then choose a different package.
